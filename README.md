# Final-About-Me-Project

So, my final project of junior year. Never thought I'd come this far. 
So, down to the nitty-gritty. I made this site for the purpose of creating a digital "resume" of myself. I got the color scheme from a picture of two legendary Pokemon, Solgaleo and Lunala. They're two beautifully designed Pokemon, so I thought that their color palettes would make my site beautiful too.
Now, you may be wondering the reason why I did not include the Family and Hobbies pages. Well, they 404'd on me at the last second, and I have no way of getting them back. Because me, being the dum-dum that I am, didn't create a backup for the files like I should. So I ended up deleting the actual files accidentally because I thought they were dummy files that showed up in my project root. I deeply apologize for that.
The story behind that was that for some reason, duplicates of my family and hobbies page popped up in my project root for no reason, I inadvertently deleted one of each file, not knowing that i had accidentally deleted BOTH the original files. They had taken me hours to perfect, and i can't redo them because then my project would be late and I would have an extra week of school.
So, I hope you have enjoyed Storytime with Jonathan. Have a nice summer, and plz rate 100/100 lol!
